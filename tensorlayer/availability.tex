\section{Availability}
TensorLayer is open sourced under the license of Apache 2.0.
It can be used in Linux, Mac OS and Windows environments.
\tl has a low adoption barrier. It provides a multilingual documentation, massive tutorials and thorough examples, such as CNNs (like VGG, ResNet, Inception), text-related applications (like text generation, Word2vec, machine translation, image captioning), GANs (text-to-image synthesis, CycleGAN, stackGAN, SRGAN), reinforcement learning algorithms (like Deep Q-Network, Policy Gradients, Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)) and etc.

\section{Acknowledge}
We would like to thank TensorLayer Open Source Community for numerous fruitful discussions. We also appreciate the feedbacks from Biye Jiang affiliated with University of California Berkeley.
